This is a fullstack web application using Node, Express, Angular 4, and CouchDB to create a "What _____ are you?" buzzfeed style quiz.
The data is pulled from the CouchDB database and is used to create the Quiz. Different types of Quizzes can be generated by creating new 
Couch documents that follow the pattern requirements of the JSON object. 

The backend is made with Node/Express which creates an API to get the Quiz data from the database and send it to the Angular frontend. 
It does this through HTTP requests to a server created through Express. 

The frontend is made with Angular 4 which uses the data provided by the backend to generate the quiz. The quiz takes the answers to the 
different questions and renders the page based on the E11 member decided through the Algorithm. It is noteworthy to mention that it is all
in run in a single page application.
